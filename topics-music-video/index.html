                    I've got a river In my head, I remember &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you said to me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got me workin' endlessly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it December?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this time, I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What it meant to me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Got me workin' endlessly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a feelin'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I wanna slow down with you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a feelin'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I wanna be there with
                    you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nobody else will ever do)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nobody else will ever do)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold it together&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, I wish I knew better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than to be alone like this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'm over it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a little like you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Don't pick up, I slide through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And never be alone like this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so over it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a feelin'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I wanna slow down with you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever
                    do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a feelin'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I wanna be there with you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nobody else will ever do)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nobody else will ever do)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody else will ever do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happenin' to me, inside my head, I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know if I could be a remedy or antidote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Want you to talk to me and see if I'm the only one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I'm draining out the water from a water gun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You caught me callin' a shrink, I didn't think you're better than me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you're
                    singin' this song like you're meant to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't wanna bow down, are you followin', are you followin' me?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happenin' to me, inside my head, I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know if I could be a
